### Spotify Podcast (PHP-based)

* A PHP-port of [ [Kittinan](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile) ] with MySQL PDO-adapter Enabled as the Database for the Port.

### Notice:
* This is a Work on Progress Port from Python, and much has been Translated already to the Project as a PHP-based SpotifyREADME for Github Profiles. Since I am using PHP-based Syntax, I used MySQL / MariaDB as the Database for the Information that will be pulled from Spotify's Database, Including a Refresh Token and Access Token.
